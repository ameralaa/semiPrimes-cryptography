2. Seed-Based Cryptographic Architecture
=================================================================

Description:
This part introduces a new cryptographic method that uses user-defined functions and multiple seed values to generate encryption logic. The security depends on the uniqueness of the function architecture and seed combination, rather than standard factorization-based methods.
